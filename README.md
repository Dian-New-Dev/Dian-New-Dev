- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dian-New-Dev, aka Diego Antunes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React while also daring my first attempts at full-stack development (NodeJS, Express).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, specially projects relating web development with personal interests of mine (mental health, self-improvement). I also intend to collaborate with open source addons and extensions for Blender.
- ⚡ Fun fact: though I've been a professor in charge of teaching Sociology, Political Science and Communications Theory to several classes of enthusiast college students, I'm currently a student myself while also trying to teach myself how to program.
